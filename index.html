    <p><b>Multi-terrain manually controlled bot using browser connectivity</b></p>
    <p>Built a service oriented multi terrain robot having potential applications based on intelligent farming system using IOT.</p><p>As robots are becoming the part of our day-to-day life, we came up with the idea of a multi-terrain manually controlled bot using browser connectivity referred as "Tera-Bot", which can help humans in many ways, especially agriculture and that can bring ease to life. The existing system was designed as a robot that is small-wheeled or legged so that it can walk on different surfaces. It consists of one or two robotic arms. It is composed of mechanical sensors and control subsystems. Since the robot is wheeled or legged, it can't walk on the surfaces like stairs. The proposed system is a service-oriented robot, which will have potential applications based on smart farming system. The bot is designed in such a way that it can move on multiple surfaces as well as artificial environment such as bricks. Secondly, the bot will have a robotic arm with detachable arrangements that can perform multiple functions like seeding, watering and weeding. It also has an additional attachment, which is the soil sensor. Arduino Uno will be used to control the soil sensor, bot and arm movements. High torque motors (60 rpm) will be used for its bi-directional movement. To make it range efficient, the bot will be controlled wirelessly over the browser using Node MCU. In conclusion, the bot that we will be making will feature Caterpillar Tracks, which is an additional advantage to moving on various terrains as well as the feature of detachable attachment enhances its performance.
